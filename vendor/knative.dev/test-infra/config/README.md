# Config

This directory contains the configuration files for the tools used in Knative's
CI/CD system. Many of the configs, especially
[Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow), are mirror
copies from [Kubernetes test-infra](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra).
For how to work with Prow for Knative, set your repository to integrate with
Prow, and add Prow jobs, please refer to [guides](../guides).
